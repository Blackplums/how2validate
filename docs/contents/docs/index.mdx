## Overview

**How2Validate** is a versatile security tool designed to streamline the process of validating sensitive secrets across various platforms and services.

Whether you're a developer, security professional, or DevOps engineer, How2Validate empowers you to ensure the authenticity and security of your API keys, tokens, and other critical information.

By leveraging the power of Python, JavaScript, and Docker, How2Validate offers a flexible and efficient solution for validating secrets against official provider endpoints. Its user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) makes it easy validating secrets, allowing you to quickly and accurately verify the integrity of your sensitive data.


## Why How2Validate ?

In today's digital landscape, the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and tokens can lead to significant security breaches. 

These vulnerabilities often arise from

- **Leaked API Keys** – Unintentional exposure through public repositories or logs
- **Invalid Credentials** – Using outdated or incorrect credentials that can compromise systems
- **Misconfigured Secrets** –  Improperly managed secrets leading to unauthorized access

How2Validate addresses these concerns by providing a robust solution to verify the authenticity and validity of your secrets directly with official providers. 

This proactive approach helps in

- **Mitigating Risks** - Prevent unauthorized access by ensuring only active secrets are used
- **Enhancing Security Posture** – Strengthen your application's security by regularly validating secrets
- **Misconfigured Secrets** –  Improperly managed secrets leading to unauthorized access
